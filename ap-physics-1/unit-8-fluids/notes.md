### **Unit 8: Fluids**

#### **1. Properties of Fluids**
- **Fluids**: Substances that can flow, including liquids and gases.
- **Density ($\rho$)**: Mass per unit volume, $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$.
- **Pressure ($P$)**: Force per unit area, $P = \frac{F}{A}$.

#### **2. Pressure in Fluids**
- **Pascal's Principle**: A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and the walls of its container.
- **Hydraulic Systems**: Use Pascal's principle to multiply force. Example: Hydraulic lift.

#### **3. Buoyancy**
- **Archimedes' Principle**: A body submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.
- **Buoyant Force ($F_b$)**: $F_b = \rho_{fluid} \cdot V_{displaced} \cdot g$.

#### **4. Fluid Dynamics**
- **Continuity Equation**: For an incompressible fluid, the product of cross-sectional area and velocity is constant along a streamline, $A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$.
- **Bernoulli's Equation**: Relates pressure, velocity, and height in a moving fluid, derived from the conservation of energy:
  $P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}$

#### **5. Applications of Fluid Dynamics**
- **Venturi Effect**: Reduction in fluid pressure when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe.
- **Airplane Wings**: Shape of wings creates different velocities above and below, generating lift due to pressure differences.
